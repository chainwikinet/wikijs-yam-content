# What Is Rebasing?

YAM changes the balance of everyone's wallets to try to reach a price of 1 yUSD.  This process is called "rebasing" and is similar to the mechanism used by [Ampleforth](https://www.ampleforth.org/).  YAM rebases—and your wallet balance of YAMs may change—every 12 hours.

Rebasing works like this:

1. if YAM is selling for more than 1.05 yUSD, increase the number of YAMs to make YAM more common.  The balance of YAMs in all wallets and contracts will increase.

2. if YAM is selling for less than 0.95 yUSD, decrease the number of YAMs to make YAM more rare.  The balance of YAMs in all wallets and contracts will decrease.

3. if YAM is selling for approximately 1yUSD (0.95-1.05 yUSD), keep the YAM balances the same.

The deviation threshold, currently at 5%, is defined in `YAMRebaser` and could be changed in the future by a tokenholder vote: https://etherscan.io/address/0x649714bc2fffcb1e65c689b49a10216d4960833d#readContract

# Supply Scaling Factor

The balance of YAMs in wallets and contracts is adjusted in the rebasing process by changing a variable called `yamScalingFactor` in the YAM contract.

`yamScalingFactor` is the value by which "OG YAM supply" (5,000,000 YAM originally planned for stakedropping, aka `balanceOfUnderlying` in the YAM contract) is multiplied in order to get the YAM balance value that is displayed in wallets, contracts, and other UIs.  

In the contract, this `yamScalingFactor` variable is scaled by x 10**-18: https://etherscan.io/token/0x0e2298E3B3390e3b945a5456fBf59eCc3f55DA16#readContract

In YAM governance, values such as `votes` are denominated in OG supply instead of in wallet balance.

# Scaling Factor History

YAM rebases happen every 12 hours: 8AM and 8PM UTC.  At this time, the `rebase` function on the `YAMRebaser` contract becomes callable by anyone.

> You—yes, YOU—can call the `rebase` function, [but only the first call mined after it becomes active will succeed](https://etherscan.io/address/0x649714bc2fffcb1e65c689b49a10216d4960833d

# How Rebases Are Calculated

The best way to understand the `rebase` calculations is to read the `rebase` code in the `YAMRebaser` contract: [0x649714bc2fffcb1e65c689b49a10216d4960833d][etherscan-rebaser]

Let's look at examples from this code to determine how to calculate how much YAM supply—and therefore wallets and contract balances—will change when a `rebase` occurs.  (Examples here are for if a `rebase` would have been triggered at 2020-08-14 13:45 Pacific Time)

Docstring description of the `rebase` function:
```
* @dev The supply adjustment equals (_totalSupply * DeviationFromTargetRate) / rebaseLag
* Where DeviationFromTargetRate is (MarketOracleRate - targetRate) / targetRate
* and targetRate is 1e18
```

- `targetRate` is the target price of YAMs.  This is 1 yUSD, expressed as `1000000000000000000` (1x10^18) in `21. targetRate` in the [YAMRebaser contract][etherscan-rebaser].
- `MarketOracleRate` is the YAM TWAP (time-weighted average price) retrieved from the Uniswap YAM:yCRV pool; the current value is displayed by `4. get CurrentTWAP` in the [YAMRebaser contract][etherscan-rebaser].
- `rebaseLag` is 10, which you can see in `14. rebaseLag` in the [YAMRebaser contract][etherscan-rebaser].

At the time of writing this example, this is how the math worked.  First, we calculate `DeviationFromTargetRate` using `targetRate` and `MarketOracleRate`:

```
 559423596560698595 MarketOracleRate (current TWAP from Uniswap)
1000000000000000000 targetRate (target price of 1 yUSD)

DeviationFromTargetRate = (MarketOracleRate - targetRate) / targetRate
DeviationFromTargetRate = (559423596560698595 - 1000000000000000000) / 1000000000000000000
                        = -0.4405764034393014
```

Now we calculate the change in supply due to the rebase using `deviationFromTargetPrice` and `rebaseLag`:

```

change in supply = _totalSupply * DeviationFromTargetRate) / rebaseLag
change in supply = _totalsupply * (-0.4405764034393014)    / (10)
change in supply = _totalSupply * (-0.04405764034393014)
                 = _totalSupply * -4.4%
```

So if the `rebase` happened at that moment, the total supply—and all YAM balances everywhere in wallets and contracts—would decrease by about 4.4%.

# YAMv1 Rebase 

Here are records of the original YAMv1 rebases. The rebases have since discontinued.
