# Launch Team

The YAM project was launched by independent Ethereum developers who were excited about DeFi and wanted to combine a bunch of new DeFi ideas to create a new rebasing stablecoin with governance.

The Yam protocol was originally crafted and launched by [Brock Elmore](https://twitter.com/brockjelmore), [Trent Elmore](https://twitter.com/trentelme), [Clinton Bembry](https://twitter.com/clintonbembryjr), [Dan Elitzer](https://twitter.com/delitzer), and [Will Price](https://twitter.com/will__price).
